# 🌟 Aligna

## 🌍 Overview

**Aligna** is a smart task scheduling and management platform that automatically prioritizes and arranges tasks based on deadlines, dependencies, and importance. Unlike traditional to-do list apps, Aligna uses intelligent scheduling to generate the most efficient execution order, ensuring prerequisite tasks are completed on time and urgent tasks are never missed. It is designed for individuals managing daily responsibilities as well as teams coordinating complex projects.
