# üåü Aligna

## üåç Overview

**Aligna** is a smart task scheduling and management platform that helps users optimize productivity by automatically prioritizing and arranging tasks based on deadlines, dependencies, and importance. Unlike basic to-do lists, Aligna uses intelligent scheduling to generate the most efficient task execution order, ensuring prerequisites are completed on time and urgent tasks are never missed.

- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)  
- MeTTa runtime (for advanced scheduling logic)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aligna.git
   cd aligna
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   **backend/.env**

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aligna
   ```

   **frontend/.env**

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. Run the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Example

### Adding Tasks

Example task definitions:

```json
{
  "name": "Write Report",
  "priority": 3,
  "deadline": "2025-09-05",
  "depends_on": ["Collect Data"]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Collect Data",
  "priority": 2,
  "deadline": "2025-09-02",
  "depends_on": ["Research Topic"]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Research Topic",
  "priority": 1,
  "deadline": "2025-09-01",
  "depends_on": []
}
```

### Scheduler Output

The system will generate the optimal task order:

```
1. Research Topic
2. Collect Data
3. Write Report
```

If a new urgent task is added, the schedule automatically re-orders in real time.
