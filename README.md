# üåü Aligna

## üåç Overview

**Aligna** is a smart task scheduling and management platform designed to **optimize productivity through intelligent task prioritization, dependency management, and real-time scheduling**. Unlike basic to-do apps, Aligna automatically arranges tasks in the most efficient order based on deadlines, priorities, and dependencies, helping individuals and teams work smarter, not harder.  

By combining a **MeTTa-based knowledge representation** for tasks with a modern web stack, Aligna enables both individuals and teams to move beyond static checklists and experience **dynamic, dependency-aware scheduling**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÑ Smart Task Scheduling
- **Automated Prioritization**: Dynamically orders tasks based on deadlines, importance, and dependencies.  
- **Dependency Management**: Ensures prerequisite tasks are completed before dependent ones.  
- **Deadline Optimization**: Highlights and prioritizes tasks with urgent due dates.  

### ü§ñ Intelligent Automation
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Schedules adapt instantly when new tasks are added or deadlines change.  
- **Next Task Recommendations**: Guides users on what to do next for maximum efficiency.  
- **Workflow Optimization**: Balances workload to minimize bottlenecks and missed deadlines.  

### üìä Visualization & Insights
- **Dependency Visualization**: Displays task relationships using clear graphs.  
- **Dynamic Task Lists**: Updates in real time as tasks are added or completed.  
- **Analytics Dashboard (Planned)**: Provides insights into productivity trends and task completion rates.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>= 18.x)  
- **npm** or **yarn**  
- **MongoDB** running locally or in the cloud  
- (Optional) MeTTa runtime for advanced scheduling  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd aligna
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in both `backend` and `frontend` directories. Example:

   **backend/.env**

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aligna
   ```

   **frontend/.env**

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Start development servers:**

   ```bash
   # Start backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Start frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Example

### 1. Adding Tasks

Users can add tasks with dependencies, deadlines, and priorities:

```json
{
  "name": "Write Report",
  "priority": 3,
  "deadline": "2025-09-05",
  "depends_on": ["Collect Data"]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Collect Data",
  "priority": 2,
  "deadline": "2025-09-02",
  "depends_on": ["Research Topic"]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Research Topic",
  "priority": 1,
  "deadline": "2025-09-01",
  "depends_on": []
}
```

### 2. Scheduler Output

The system automatically generates the optimal execution order:

```
1. Research Topic  
2. Collect Data  
3. Write Report  
```

If a new urgent task with an earlier deadline is added, the system **recalculates** in real time.

### 3. Dependency Graph

Tasks can be visualized as a dependency graph in the frontend:

```
Research Topic ‚Üí Collect Data ‚Üí Write Report
```
